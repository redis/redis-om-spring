 * <li><strong>Counting functions:</strong> COUNT, COUNT_DISTINCT, COUNT_DISTINCTISH</li>
 * <li><strong>Mathematical functions:</strong> SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, STDDEV</li>
 * <li><strong>Statistical functions:</strong> QUANTILE, RANDOM_SAMPLE</li>
 * <li><strong>Collection functions:</strong> TOLIST, FIRST_VALUE</li>
