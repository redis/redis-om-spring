/**
 * A fluent API for building and executing Redis aggregation queries.
 * AggregationStream provides a chainable interface for constructing complex aggregation
 * pipelines that can perform operations like grouping, filtering, sorting, and applying
 * reducer functions on Redis data.
 * 
 * <p>The aggregation stream follows a builder pattern where each method returns a new
 * stream instance with the additional operation applied. This allows for flexible
 * composition of aggregation operations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<ProductStats> results = entityStream
 *     .load(Product$.category, Product$.price)
 *     .filter("@price:[100 500]")
 *     .groupBy(Product$.category)
 *     .reduce(ReducerFunction.SUM, Product$.price)
 *     .sorted(Order.desc("category"))
 *     .limit(10)
 *     .toList(ProductStats.class);
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Key features:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Fluent API for building aggregation pipelines</li>
 * <li>Support for field loading, filtering, and grouping</li>
 * <li>Rich set of reducer functions for data analysis</li>
 * <li>Pagination and sorting capabilities</li>
 * <li>Cursor-based processing for large datasets</li>
 * <li>Timeout support for long-running operations</li>
 * </ul>
