== Spring Boot Version Compatibility Policy

Redis OM Spring follows an **N-2 support policy** for Spring Boot versions:

* We build with the latest stable Spring Boot version
* We support the current version and two previous minor versions that are still receiving OSS updates
* We upgrade Spring Boot with each Redis OM Spring release

=== Example

As of Redis OM Spring 1.0.0-RC4 (August 2025):

* **Built with**: Spring Boot 3.4.8
* **Minimum supported**: Spring Boot 3.3.x (OSS support until June 2025)
* **Recommended**: Spring Boot 3.4.x or 3.5.x

[WARNING]
====
Using older Spring Boot versions may work but is not officially tested or supported. For production use, we recommend staying within the supported version range.
====

== How the Support Policy Works

=== Release Schedule

Spring Boot releases follow a predictable schedule:

* New major or minor versions every 6 months (May and November)
* OSS support for 12 months per minor version
* Commercial support available for extended periods

=== Our Approach

1. **On each Redis OM Spring release**: We update to the latest stable Spring Boot version
2. **Minimum version**: We support versions that are still receiving OSS updates
3. **Testing**: We test against all supported Spring Boot versions in our CI pipeline

=== Determining Supported Versions

To determine which Spring Boot versions Redis OM Spring supports:

1. Check the `springBootVersion` in `gradle.properties` - this is what we build with
2. Check the https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support[Spring Boot support timeline]
3. We support the build version and any previous minor versions still receiving OSS updates

== Upgrading Spring Boot

If you need to upgrade your Spring Boot version:

1. Check the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.x-Release-Notes[Spring Boot release notes] for breaking changes
2. Update your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` to use the new version
3. Run your tests to ensure compatibility
4. Pay special attention to:
   * Spring Data Redis changes
   * Spring Framework changes
   * Java version requirements

== Java Version Requirements

Redis OM Spring requires Java 17 or higher because:

* Spring Boot 3.x requires Java 17 as a minimum
* We use Java 17 language features in our codebase
* Java 17 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release

We recommend using Java 17 or Java 21 (the next LTS) for production deployments.

== Redis Requirements

Redis OM Spring requires Redis Stack or Redis with specific modules:

* **Minimum Redis version**: 6.2.x
* **Recommended**: Redis Stack 7.2.x or later
* **Required modules**:
  ** RedisJSON for document storage
  ** RediSearch for indexing and querying

You can run Redis Stack using Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack:latest
----

Or Redis 8.0+ which includes these capabilities:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:8.0.0
----

== Dependency Version Alignment

When using Redis OM Spring, ensure your dependencies are aligned:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <spring-boot.version>3.4.5</spring-boot.version>
    <redis-om-spring.version>1.0.0-RC4</redis-om-spring.version>
</properties>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.redis.om</groupId>
        <artifactId>redis-om-spring</artifactId>
        <version>${redis-om-spring.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Spring Boot dependencies will be managed by the parent POM -->
</dependencies>
----

[TIP]
====
Use Spring Boot's dependency management to ensure all Spring-related dependencies are aligned with your Spring Boot version.
