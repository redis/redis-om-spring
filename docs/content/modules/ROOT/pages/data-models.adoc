== Overview

Redis OM Spring provides two powerful data models for mapping Java objects to Redis, each optimized for different use cases. This page helps you understand when and how to use each model effectively.

== Supported Data Models

Redis OM Spring focuses on two primary data models that provide the best combination of performance, flexibility, and search capabilities:

=== 1. Enhanced Redis Hash Model

Redis OM Spring enhances the traditional `@RedisHash` annotation from Spring Data Redis with powerful search capabilities. This model stores objects as Redis Hash data structures with automatic indexing for searchable fields.

[source,java]
----
@RedisHash
public class Product {
    @Id
    private String id;
    
    @TextIndexed 
    private String name;
    
    @NumericIndexed
    private double price;
    
    @TagIndexed
    private String category;
    
    private String description;  // Stored but not indexed
    
    // getters and setters
}
----

**Key Benefits:**

* **High Performance**: Extremely fast for simple object operations
* **Memory Efficient**: Optimal memory usage for flat object structures  
* **Search-Enabled**: Full-text search, numeric ranges, and tag filtering
* **Spring Data Compatible**: Works with existing Spring Data Redis code
* **Vector Efficient**: Most space-efficient storage for AI embeddings and vectors

=== 2. JSON Document Model

The `@Document` annotation maps Java objects to Redis JSON documents, providing native support for complex nested structures, collections, and hierarchical data.

[source,java]
----
@Document
public class Customer {
    @Id
    private String id;
    
    @Searchable 
    private String name;
    
    @GeoIndexed
    private Point location;
    
    // Nested object with searchable fields
    private Address address;
    
    // Collections are stored as JSON arrays
    private List<Order> orders;
    
    // getters and setters
}

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Address {
    @TextIndexed
    private String street;
    
    @TextIndexed
    private String city;
    
    @TagIndexed
    private String zipCode;
    
    private String country;
}

@Data
public class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private LocalDate orderDate;
    
    @NumericIndexed
    private BigDecimal totalAmount;
    
    private List<LineItem> items;
}
----

**Key Benefits:**

* **Complex Structures**: Native support for nested objects and collections
* **Schema Flexibility**: Easy to evolve object structures over time
* **Rich Queries**: Query on nested properties and array elements  
* **JSON Native**: Leverages Redis's native JSON capabilities

== Choosing the Right Data Model

Use this guide to select the optimal data model for your use case:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Factor |Enhanced Redis Hash (`@RedisHash`) |JSON Document (`@Document`)

|**Object Complexity**
|Simple, flat objects with basic properties
|Complex objects with nested structures and collections

|**Query Requirements**
|Field-level search and filtering
|Nested property queries and array element searches

|**Performance Priority**
|Maximum performance for simple operations
|Balanced performance for complex data operations

|**Memory Usage**
|Extremely memory efficient
|More memory usage but better for complex data

|**Schema Evolution**
|Requires careful planning for changes
|Natural support for schema evolution

|**Spring Data Migration**
|Drop-in replacement for existing `@RedisHash` code
|New development or complex data requirements

|**Vector Storage Efficiency**
|More space-efficient for vectors and embeddings
|Less space-efficient but supports vectors in nested objects
|===

== Decision Framework

=== Choose Enhanced Redis Hash When:

✅ **Simple Domain Objects**: Your entities have mostly primitive fields and minimal nesting

✅ **Maximum Performance**: You need the absolute fastest read/write operations

✅ **Memory Constraints**: Memory efficiency is a top priority

✅ **Legacy Integration**: You're enhancing existing Spring Data Redis applications

✅ **High Throughput**: You have very high-volume, simple operations

=== Choose JSON Document When:

✅ **Complex Data Models**: Your objects have nested structures, collections, or hierarchical relationships

✅ **Rich Querying**: You need to search within nested objects or array elements

✅ **Schema Flexibility**: Your data model evolves frequently or varies between instances

✅ **Nested Vectors**: You need vector embeddings within nested objects or collections

✅ **Modern Applications**: You're building new applications with complex data requirements

== AI and Vector Capabilities

Both data models support AI integration and vector search:

* **Hash Model**: More space-efficient for vector storage, ideal for simple entities with embeddings
* **Document Model**: Supports vectors within nested structures, better for complex AI applications

Choose based on your data structure needs, not AI requirements.

== Practical Examples

=== Hash Model: User Profile with AI
[source,java]
----
@RedisHash
public class UserProfile {
    @Id private String userId;
    @TextIndexed private String username;
    @NumericIndexed private int age;
    @TagIndexed private String status;
    @GeoIndexed private Point lastLocation;
    
    // Vector embeddings are space-efficient in Hash model
    @VectorIndexed(algorithm = VectorAlgorithm.HNSW,
                   type = VectorType.FLOAT32,
                   dimension = 384,
                   distanceMetric = DistanceMetric.COSINE)
    private float[] profileEmbedding;
}
----

=== Document Model: E-commerce Order
[source,java]
----
@Document
public class Order {
    @Id private String orderId;
    @Searchable private String customerName;
    private Address shippingAddress;    // Nested object
    private List<OrderItem> items;      // Collection with potential vectors
    private PaymentInfo payment;        // Nested object
    
    // Vectors work in JSON but are less space-efficient
    @VectorIndexed(algorithm = VectorAlgorithm.HNSW,
                   type = VectorType.FLOAT32,
                   dimension = 384,
                   distanceMetric = DistanceMetric.COSINE)
    private float[] contentEmbedding;
}
