= Repositories with Redis OM Spring

The purpose of the Spring Data repositories is to provide a data-access bridge expressed in the language of
mapped entities. We can think of repositories as a higher-level of abstraction than DAOs (Data Access Objects).

In Spring, different Spring Data libraries provide different levels of capabilities in their repositories,
based on the capabilities of the underlying data store. In Spring Data Redis, the framework that Redis OM
Spring builds upon the repositories are based on the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/keyvalue/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/keyvalue/repository/KeyValueRepository.html[`KeyValueRepository`].

To support simple property searches, Spring Data Redis uses redis data structures to create secondary indices. This is
no longer necessary when using Redis OM Spring which relies on Redis Stack's Query Engine to create proper search indices. As of Redis 8, the Query Engine is a standard component of Redis.

Redis OM Spring supports two different types of repositories:

* **Hash Repositories**: "Enhanced" Hash Repositories via `RedisEnhancedRepository` extends `KeyValueRepository` to back all search-related
repository operations with Redis Query Engine (formerly RediSearch) queries and aggregations.

* **Document Repositories**: Document ("JSON") Repositories via `RedisDocumentRepository` extends  `KeyValueRepository` to back all search-related
repository operations with Redis Query Engine queries and aggregations.

== Setup

The repository infrastructure can be enabled using the Redis Stack specific annotations `@EnableRedisEnhancedRepositories`
and `@EnableRedisDocumentRepositories` a JavaConfig class.

For example, to enable "enhanced" Redis Hash Repositories use:

====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableEnhancedRedisRepositories("com.acme.repositories")
class ApplicationConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory() {
    // …
  }
}
----

A typical place to put the `@EnableRedisEnhancedRepositories` or `@EnableRedisDocumentRepository` is on your
`@SpringBootApplication` annotated main class:

====
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableRedisDocumentRepositories
public class RomsDocumentsApplication {

  @Autowired
  CompanyRepository companyRepo;

  // …
}
----

== Built-in Repository Methods

Both `RedisEnhancedRepository` and `RedisDocumentRepository` extend `KeyValueRepository` which is a combination of `ListCrudRepository` and `ListPagingAndSortingRepository`. The interface `ListCrudRepository` extends the foundational
`CrudRepository` and `ListPagingAndSortingRepository` extends `PagingAndSortingRepository` as well, this hierarchy is shown in the following diagram:

=== OM Repositories Common Methods

The following table lists the common methods implemented by `RedisEnhancedRepository` and `RedisDocumentRepository`, these methods deal mostly with entities IDs, retrieving/projecting individual fields, and TTLs (Time-to-live):

|===
|Method |Description

|Iterable<ID> getIds()
|Returns an Iterable containing all the IDs in the collection

|Page<ID> getIds(Pageable pageable)
|Returns a paged collection of IDs

|<F> Iterable<F> getFieldsByIds(Iterable<ID> ids, MetamodelField<T, F> field)
|Returns an iterable of field values for a given field for the provided IDs

|Long getExpiration(ID id)
|Returns the remaining time to live of a ID that has a timeout. This introspection capability allows a Redis client to check how many seconds a given key will continue to be part of the dataset. Returns -2 if the key does not exist, -1 if the key exists but has no associated expire.

|<S extends T> S update(S entity)
|Updates/upserts the given entity

|===

=== CrudRepository

The CrudRepository provides sophisticated CRUD functionality for the entity class that is being managed.
The following table lists the methods implemented from https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html[CrudRepository] which exposes generic CRUD operations on a repository for a specific type:

|===
|Method |Description

|long count()
|Returns the number of entities available.

|void delete(T entity)
|Deletes a given entity.

|void deleteAll()
|Deletes all entities managed by the repository.

|void deleteAll(Iterable<? extends T> entities)
|Deletes the given entities.

|void deleteAllById(Iterable<? extends ID> ids)
|Deletes all instances of the type T with the given IDs.

|void deleteById(ID id)
|Deletes the entity with the given id.

|boolean existsById(ID id)
|Returns whether an entity with the given id exists.

|Iterable<T> findAll()
|Returns all instances of the type.

|Iterable<T> findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids)
|Returns all instances of the type T with the given IDs.

|Optional<T> findById(ID id)
|Retrieves an entity by its id.

|<S extends T> S save(S entity)
|Saves a given entity.

|<S extends T> Iterable<S> saveAll(Iterable<S> entities)
|Saves all given entities.
|===

=== ListCrudRepository

The following table lists the methods implemented from https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/ListCrudRepository.html[ListCrudRepository] which adds finder versions returning `List` rather than `Iterable`:

|===
|Method |Description

|List<T> findAll()
|Returns all instances of the type.

|List<T> findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids)
|Returns all instances of the type T with the given IDs.

|<S extends T> List<S> saveAll(Iterable<S> entities)
|Saves all given entities.
|===

=== PagingSortingRepository

On top of the CrudRepository there is a https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html[`PagingAndSortingRepository`] abstraction that adds additional methods to ease paginated access to entities. The following table lists the methods implemented from https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html[PagingSortingRepository] which exposes methods to retrieve entities using the pagination and sorting abstraction:

|===
|Method |Description

|Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable)
|Returns a Page of entities meeting the paging restriction provided in the Pageable object.

|Iterable<T> findAll(Sort sort)
|Returns all entities sorted by the given options.
|===

=== ListPagingAndSortingRepository

The following table lists the methods implemented from https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/ListPagingAndSortingRepository.html[ListPagingAndSortingRepository] which adds finder versions returning `List` rather than `Iterable`:

|===
|Method |Description

|List<T> findAll(Sort sort)
|Returns all entities sorted by the given options.
|===

== Query Methods

Standard CRUD functionality repositories usually have queries on the underlying datastore. With Spring Data, declaring those queries becomes a four-step process:
