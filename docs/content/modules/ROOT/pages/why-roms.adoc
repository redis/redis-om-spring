= Why Redis OM Spring?
:page-toclevels: 3
:page-pagination:

While Spring Data Redis provides excellent foundational Redis connectivity for Spring applications, Redis OM Spring builds upon this solid foundation to offer enhanced capabilities specifically designed for Redis 8+ and its powerful built-in modules. This page explains the additional value Redis OM Spring brings to your development experience.

== Redis OM Spring's Enhanced Capabilities

Redis OM Spring extends Spring Data Redis with specialized features that unlock the full potential of Redis's advanced search, JSON, and analytics capabilities:

== Key Enhancements Redis OM Spring Provides

Redis OM Spring enhances your Redis development experience by adding:

=== 1. Advanced Search-Enabled Object Mapping

Redis OM Spring extends object mapping with declarative search capabilities that work seamlessly with Redis's built-in search engine:

[source,java]
----
// Standard Spring Data Redis Hash
@RedisHash("person")
public class Person {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
}

// Redis OM Spring Document with built-in search indexing
@Document
public class Person {
    @Id
    private String id;
    
    @Searchable         // Full-text search capability
    private String name;
    
    @NumericIndexed     // Range and numeric queries
    private int age;
    
    @GeoIndexed         // Geospatial queries
    private Point location;
    
    @VectorIndexed(     // Vector similarity search
        algorithm = VectorAlgorithm.HNSW,
        type = VectorType.FLOAT32,
        dimension = 384, 
        distanceMetric = DistanceMetric.COSINE
    )
    private float[] embedding;
}
----

=== 2. Built-in Redis Module Integration

Redis OM Spring provides native integration with Redis's powerful built-in modules, enabling:

* **Search Engine Integration**: Full-text search with stemming, phonetics, and fuzzy matching
* **JSON Support**: Native JSON document storage with nested object querying
* **Vector Search**: AI-powered similarity search and recommendations
* **Geospatial Queries**: Location-based search and proximity filtering
* **Aggregations**: Advanced analytics and data summarization

=== 3. Automatic Index Management

Redis OM Spring automatically creates and manages search indices based on your entity annotations, eliminating manual index setup:

[source,java]
----
@EnableRedisDocumentRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    // Redis OM Spring automatically creates indices for all 
    // annotated entities in your application
}
----

=== 4. Enhanced Repository Pattern

Redis OM Spring extends Spring Data's repository pattern with Redis search and analytics capabilities:

[source,java]
----
public interface ProductRepository extends RedisDocumentRepository<Product, String> {
    // Familiar Spring Data method naming conventions
    List<Product> findByNameStartingWith(String prefix);
    List<Product> findByPriceBetween(BigDecimal min, BigDecimal max);
    
    // Enhanced with Redis search query syntax
    @Query("@category:{electronics} @price:[100 500]")
    List<Product> findElectronicsInPriceRange();
    
    // Built-in aggregation support
    @Aggregation("@category:{$category} GROUPBY 1 @brand REDUCE COUNT 0 AS count")
    AggregationResult getBrandCounts(@Param("category") String category);
}
----

=== 5. Type-Safe Fluent Query API

Redis OM Spring adds a modern, type-safe query API inspired by Java 8 Streams:

[source,java]
----
// Type-safe queries with compile-time checking
List<Product> products = entityStream
    .of(Product.class)
    .filter(
        Product$.CATEGORY.eq("electronics")
        .and(Product$.PRICE.between(100, 500))
    )
    .sorted(Product$.PRICE, SortOrder.DESC)
    .limit(10)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Advanced aggregations with tuples
List<Pair<String, Long>> brandCounts = entityStream
    .of(Product.class)
    .groupBy(Product$.BRAND)
    .reduce(ReducerFunction.COUNT).as("count")
    .sorted(Order.desc("@count"))
    .toList(String.class, Long.class);
----

=== 6. Enhanced JSON Document Support

Redis OM Spring provides seamless integration with Redis's native JSON capabilities for complex document structures:

[source,java]
----
@Document
public class Order {
    @Id
    private String id;
    
    @Searchable
    private String customerName;
    
    @Indexed
    private OrderStatus status;
    
    // Nested collections are automatically serialized to JSON
    private List<OrderItem> items;
    
    // Complex nested objects with searchable fields
    @Indexed
    private Address shippingAddress;
    
    // Nested objects can have their own search annotations
    public static class OrderItem {
        @Searchable
        private String productName;
        
        @NumericIndexed  
        private BigDecimal price;
        
        private int quantity;
    }
}
----
